# Examples

There are examples for every structure in the package within the package's ```examples/``` folder.
The code for several of these examples is provided here.

## ART

All ART modules learn in an unsupervised (i.e. clustering) mode by default, but they all can accept labels in the simplified ARTMAP fashion.

### Distributed Dual Vigilance Fuzzy ART (DDVFA)

```julia
art = DDVFA()
```

## ARTMAP

### Simplified Fuzzy ARTMAP (SFAM)

```julia
art = SFAM()
```
